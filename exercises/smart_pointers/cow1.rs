// This exercise explores the Cow, or Clone-On-Write type. Cow is a
// clone-on-write smart pointer. It can enclose and provide immutable access to
// borrowed data, and clone the data lazily when mutation or ownership is
// required. The type is designed to work with general borrowed data via the
// Borrow trait.
//
// This exercise is meant to show you what to expect when passing data to Cow.
// Fix the unit tests by checking for Cow::Owned(_) and Cow::Borrowed(_) at the
// TODO markers.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint cow1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.

// I wonder what a practical use case is for this. Is it just that it can
// auto-clone only when necessary? So that the borrow flow doesn't waste memory?

use std::borrow::Cow;

// This function takes a mutable Cow pointer to an array of i32. It returns the
// same thing. All it is doing is iterating over the array of i32 and if the
// item is negative, it:
//  - clones the array, so that it owns a copy of the array and can mutate it
//  - flips the sign of the current item and stores it in the same position
//
// I can't remember how clones work. Does a cloned object have the same
// __lifetime__ as the original one? What is even being cloned here? We do
// `input.to_mut()`, and input is a Cow. So that implies we copy the Cow.
// However, the docstring above states that it can "clone the data lazily"

        let v = input[i];
        if v < 0 {
            // Clones into a vector if not already owned.

            // So I guess it does the clone exactly once -- when this line is
            // hit for the first time. Then the next time the line gets hit, the
            // Cow is already owned, so no clone happens.
